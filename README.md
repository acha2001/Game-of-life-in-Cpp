GAME OF LIFE 3/28/2022

Project Idea:
We are going to recreate the game of life from this " https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQX2HjkcNo&t=247s ".
Try to only use c++.

Goals:
 - Make it run on black and white jpg. 
 - It should run in the terminal. 
 - Should run infinitly.
 - Can move view over the program.
 - Can speed up and slow down time .

Progress 3/30:
 - I have set up a basic display program that we can just call update 
 in a loop to iterate throught the game. 
 - I still need to figure out a good way to read the data in a .txt 
 file and put it into the display.
